                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <h5>Computer Science <span>Student</span></h5>
                    <p> As a second-year <span>Computer Science</span> student at <span>Concordia University</span>, my passion began as I started to understand the back-end knowledge in the dynamic realms of <span>software development</span>, with an interest in exploring the intersections of machine learning and <span>cybersecurity</span>.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Beyond my academic pursuits, I am engaged in continuous learning by staying updated on industry trends and technologies.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Currently, I am honing my expertise in <span>back-end development</span> and <span>front-end development</span> through self-paced learning initiatives. 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        As a beginner in the field, I am working on gaining practical experience and further expanding my abilities through hands-on opportunities by participating in hackathons, workshops, and being a member of tech societies.
