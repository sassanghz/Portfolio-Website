                    <h5>Computer Science <span>Student</span></h5>
                    <p>As a second-year <span>Computer Science</span> student at <span>Concordia University</span>, my passion lies in the dynamic realms of software and web development, with an interest in exploring the intersections of <span>machine learning</span> and <span>cybersecurity</span>. Eager to contribute my skills and knowledge,  I am actively seeking a fall internship in <span>software development</span>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I am engaged in continuous learning by staying updated on industry trends and technologies. Currently, I am honing my expertise in <span>back-end development</span> and <span>front-end development</span> through self-paced learning initiatives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to my developing technical skills, I am cultivating a proactive and <span>collaborative mindset</span>. 
                        I am enthusiastic about the prospect of actively contributing to innovative projects and believe that my eagerness to learn aligns well with the expectations for a <span>software development internship</span>. 
                        As a beginner in the field, I am keen on gaining practical experience and further refining my abilities through hands-on opportunities. 
                        I am confident that my dedication and willingness to <span>embrace challenges</span> make me a <span>promising candidate</span> for this internship.
